	<h2>Commitment</h2>
	<p>Getting a pet is a huge commitment and therefore it must be taken seriously. A person or group of people looking to adopt a pet must do extensive research to ensure they are up to the task of caring for another living being at that time. They also must take into account that depending on the animal they get they could be taking care of it for a long time.</p> 
	<h2>Pet care</h2>
	<p>Taking care of an animal can be a challenge. Dogs for example must be given ample room to excersise and should be taken on regular walks. The pet owners must also think about the food for the animal. What will it eat? How much should it eat each day? These are things pet owners need to consider.</p>
