Step 1: First we need clone the project into our directory,
so open up your bash editor, and type the command "git clone url". 
So for our team, the command is "git clone https://github.com/CSI-280/beaversquad"

Step 2: Now a directory is created called "beaversquad", so all we have to do is move into
this directory. To do this, run the command "cd beaversquad". The only problem is anything we do here
gets changed on the main branch, so we will want to make our own branch. 

Step 3: To create a new branch, we write the command "checkout -b branchname", and just replace 
"branchname" with what you want to call your branch. 

Step 4: Now we have our own branch that we are free to work on. We can either work on the files from the
editor, or we can change the physical files.
